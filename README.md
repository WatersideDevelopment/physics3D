The main/non-core (files to pay attention to) files for this demo are:

lib/three.js/main.js - orchestrates all the three.js stuff and bridges the gap between Impact + three.js
lib/three.js/jetpackFlame.js - jetpack effects
lib/impact-wrapper.js - generates and stores the required 3D meshes for all Impact entities
